# TSP & VRP Optimization with Metaheuristics

This repository provides Python implementations of several metaheuristic optimization algorithms applied to two classical combinatorial optimization problems:

- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**  
- **Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP)**

The implemented algorithms include:

- **SA** â€“ Simulated Annealing  
- **ACO** â€“ Ant Colony Optimization  
- **Tabu** â€“ Tabu Search  
- **GA** â€“ Genetic Algorithm  

These algorithms are widely used to tackle NP-hard optimization problems where exact methods are computationally infeasible for large instances.
